## Hackathon: PDF to Excel Data Extraction

### Description
This project is a Python script that processes a PDF file, extracts structured data, and saves it into an Excel file. The script utilizes the `PyMuPDF` (fitz) library for reading PDF content and `openpyxl` for handling Excel operations.

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `PyMuPDF` (`fitz`)
  - `openpyxl`

To install the required dependencies, run:
```sh
pip install pymupdf openpyxl
```

### Usage
1. Place the input PDF file in the appropriate directory.
2. Modify the script to point to the correct input and output file paths.
3. Run the script using:
```sh
python main.py
```
4. The extracted data will be saved in the specified Excel file.

### Input
- `test3 (1).pdf`: A bank statement or similar structured document.

### Output
- `output.xlsx`: An Excel file containing the extracted structured data from the PDF.

### Functionality
- Opens the PDF file and reads its content.
- Converts structured data into tab-separated format.
- Writes extracted data into an Excel spreadsheet.

### File Details
#### `main.py`
This script processes the PDF file and extracts relevant data. It performs the following operations:
- Opens the PDF document.
- Reads text content from each page.
- Cleans and structures data using regular expressions and string manipulations.
- Saves structured data into an Excel file.

#### `test3 (1).pdf`
A sample input file used to test the script. It contains a structured bank statement with transactions.

#### `output.xlsx`
The output Excel file generated by the script, containing extracted data in tabular format.

### Notes
- Ensure that the input PDF file follows a structured format for accurate extraction.
- Modify the script as needed to handle variations in formatting.
- The script does not perform extensive error handling; consider adding try-except blocks for robustness.
